# Arduino-Projects
Learning Arduino by doing projects, ranging from theoretical projects to hands-on projects that I actually build!
- I focus on real-world applications instead of just theory
- Anki flashcards for memorization of certain concepts
- Comprehensive documentation in code with comments
- Explorations into many concepts such as sensors, motors, and displays to broaden skillset
- Maintain portfolio of projects to track progress as I learn until I have a good enough grip on Arduino to do large standalone projects
